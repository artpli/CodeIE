## Introduction

Our codebase is mainly modified from the [UIE](https://github.com/universal-ie/UIE) and [CoCoGen](https://github.com/reasoning-machines/CoCoGen) repositories.
We obtained and processed the original NER and RE datasets according to UIE's workflow.
Then we implemented the inference logic of CodeIE referring to CoCoGen's workflow.
Finally we evaluated the model outputs based on UIE's evaluation process.

We sincerely thank these two works and previous works.

## Notice
1. A piece of not-so-good news is that the `Codex` models are now [deprecated by OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code), which will have a significant impact on replicating this paper. Some possible solutions include applying for OpenAI's [Researcher Access Program](https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program) or accessing Codex on [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/work-with-code).
2. Since we are using the closed-source APIs of OpenAI, we are unaware of the technical details behind them, such as the specific pre-training corpora used. Therefore, there might be potential issues of [data contamination](https://hitz-zentroa.github.io/lm-contamination/blog/) in the evaluation of our paper.
